## Jarvis Voice Assistant
This project is a Python-based voice assistant that uses text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition to interact with the user. 
It is named "Jarvis," inspired by the virtual assistant in the Iron Man movies.

## Features
Speech Recognition: Listens to the user's voice commands using a microphone.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Responds to the user's commands with synthesized speech.
Wake Word Detection: Responds when the wake word "Jarvis" is detected in the user's command.

## Requirements
Before running the program, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

## Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech engine)
speech_recognition (Speech recognition library)

## How to Run
Save the code to a file, e.g., jarvis.py.
run by usig this command  : python jarvis.py
Speak into your microphone when prompted. Use the wake word "Jarvis" in your command to trigger a response.
